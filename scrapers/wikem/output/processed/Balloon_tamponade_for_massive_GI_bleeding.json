Don't use anything other than Kelly clamps Can connect suction to gastric suction but in general, ignore all ports other than gastric inflation.\nNo need to use esophageal tube or manometer as MOST of the time the gastric tamponade will be sufficient and you don’t want to risk over inflating the esophagus Have someone count with you to not lose count of how much air you’ve inserted!",
