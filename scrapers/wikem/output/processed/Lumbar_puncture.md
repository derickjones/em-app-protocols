## Overview

Comparison of pediatric and adult spinal cord anatomy.
Anatomic landmarks for lumbar puncture.

## Indications

Lateral patient positioning for LP.
Surface markings for lumbar puncture.  Blue dots = Iliac crests; line connecting them = intercristal (Tuffier's) line; intersection of the Tuffier's line and lumbar spine midline = L4 spinous process.
Proper needle trajectory: skin, subcutaneous tissue, supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum, epidural space (containing internal vertebral venous plexus), dura, arachnoid, and subarachnoid space
Suspicion of meningitis [1]
Suspicion of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) [2]
Suspicion of certain central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as Guillain-Barré syndrome [3]
Therapeutic relief of pseudotumor cerebri [4]

## Contraindications

Infection at LP site
Suspected spinal epidural abscess
Trauma at the site

### Lumbar puncture if coagulopathic

Tranfuse if platelets <25,000 [5] [6]
INR >1.5
Hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, other coagulopathies If hemophiliac, replace factor before LP

### CT Before Lumbar Puncture

LP without CT is likely safe if: [7]
History Age < 60 Not immunocompromised No history of CNS disease No seizure within 1 week of presentation
Physical Exam No altered level of consciousness Ability to answer two consecutive questions successfully Ability to follow two consecutive commands successfully Normal neurologic exam
If none of the above, chance of normal ct is 97%; none of the patients herniated
CT findings that prohibit LP: [8]
Midline shift Unequal pressures between the 3 cerebral compartments (left/right supretentorial compartments, posterior fossa) Intracerebral masses not causing midline shift
Obstructive Hydrocephalus Enlargement of ventricles prox to lesions and normal ventricles distal (especially 4th ventricle)
Basilar cisterns compressed Lateral/3rd ventricles may be small due to diffuse cerebral edema or enlarged due to obstr. hydroceph. +/- shift
Posterior fossa mass Displacement/compression of 4th ventricle

## Procedure

Ultrasound can be used, especially on high BMI patients. Ultrasound videos one , two , and three . Routine use of Ultrasound, however, has not been shown to increase procedural success, use in specific scenarios only [9]
Sterile prep L3-L4 and L4-L5 interspaces; prepare and confirm correct tubes in numerical order U/S can be used to ID interspaces in obese patients increasing your accuracy as much as 2.3 times [10] Aim lower than L4-L5 and no higher in pediatric patients as the conus medullaris ends at L3 at birth [11] Tuffier's line, L5/S1 at iliac crests in the pediatric patient
Positioning Patient on side: able to measure opening pressure Patient sitting: helpful for difficult habitus, but must move patient to measure opening pressure
Needle selection 3.5 in atraumatic 22ga needle is ideal A 2018 meta analysis showed atraumatic needles had a lower incidence of post-LP headache and need for blood patch when compared to sharp needles [12] Needle >20ga almost doubles incidence of post-LP headache
Anesthetize both superficial skin as well as along intended path of LP needle
Insert needle with bevel parallel to spinal canal
Opening pressure should be measured with patient on side with legs extended
Collect 1mL of CSF in each tube

### Standard

Tube 1: Cell count and differential
Tube 2: Gram stain, bacterial and viral cultures
Tube 3: Glucose, protein, protein electrophoresis (if indicated)
Tube 4: Second cell count and differential (if indicated) or hold tube Tube 3 or 4 can be used for special tests or additional cultures

### Additional

Cryptoccal ag
India ink
AFB PCR
RPR, VRDL
Fungal cultures
viral cultures
Herpes PCR
LDH >40 suggests bacterial meningitis <40 suggests viral

## Evaluation

Measure Normal Bacterial Aseptic (Viral) Fungal Tuberculosis Subarachnoid hemorrhage Neoplastic Appearance Clear Clear, cloudy, or purulent Clear Clear or opaque Clear or opaque Xanthochromia, bloody, or clear Clear or opaque Opening Pressure (cm H2O) 10-20 >25 Normal or elevated >25 >25 >25 Normal or elevated WBC Count^ (cells/µL) 0-5^ >100^ 5-1000 <500 50-500 0-5 (see correction section) <500 % PMNs >80-90% 1-50%^^ 1-50% Early PMN then lymph 1-50% Glucose >60% of serum glucose Low Normal Low Low Normal Normal Protein^^^ (mg/dL) < 45 Elevated Elevated Elevated Elevated Elevated >200 Gram Stain Neg Pos Neg India ink Tb stain Blood
^Normal or lower WBC results may be found in immunocompromised, early, or partially treated (e.g. with oral antibiotics) bacterial menintigis, and those with tuberculosis meningitis
^^Lymph predominance may be found in patients with early bacterial meningitis or those that have been partially treated (e.g. with oral antibiotics)
^^^For unexplained elevations of protein, consider encephalitis , MS , Guillian Barre
Corrections
WBC correction (for bloody tap) Simplified version (if peripheral WBC and RBC counts are within normal limits): Subtract 1 WBC for every 750 RBC in CSF Complex version (WBC and/or RBC not within normal limits): "WBCs added" = WBC(blood) x [RBC(CSF) / RBC(blood)] WBC counted/resulted - "WBCs added" = actual WBC
Protein correction (for bloody tap) For each 1000 RBC decrease protein value by 1mg/dl

#### Delay in LP

CSF cultures are negative 2 hrs after parenteral antibiotics in meningococcal meningitis, and 6 hrs in pneumococcal meningitis [13] [14]
12 hrs after antibiotics: CSF glucose levels increase and protein levels decrease. CSF WBC and neutrophils are not affected [15]

## Complications

Post-Lumbar Puncture Headache
Spinal epidural hematoma
