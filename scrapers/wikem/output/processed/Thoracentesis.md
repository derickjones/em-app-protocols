Categories: Procedures, Pulmonary

## Indications

New-onset pleural effusion (except obvious CHF -induced effusion)
Symptomatic pleural effusion

### Thoracentesis if coagulopathic

Platelets <50K [1]
INR >2x normal [1]
Mechanical ventilation

## Equipment Needed

Thoracentesis kit
Sterile gloves
Chlorhexidine or betadine scrub
Evacuated container
Ultrasound

## Procedure

Left pleura cavity (viewed from left) showing intercostal bundles (vein, artery, and nerve) under ribs.
Choose insertion site/positioning Upright position in mid-scapular or posterior axillary line (usual technique) Lateral decubitus position with fluid side down in post axillary line (if cannot sit up) Supine with head elevated as much as possible in midaxillary line (chest tube location)
Cleanse skin with chlorhexidine or betadine
Anesthetize skin and subcutaneous tissue - raise wheal and advance/inject along superior aspect of lower rib (avoid NV bundle)
Make small skin nick with scalpel
Insert/advance needle while continuously aspirating until pleural space is entered
Advance catheter into pleural space while removing needle
Connect tubing to catheter and to evacuated container and remove desired amount of fluid
Obtain post-procedure CXR if: Multiple needle passes required Air is aspirated Risk of adhesions New-onset of symptoms during the procedure (chest pain, dyspnea) Patient at high risk for decompensation from small pneumothorax (lung disease, positive pressure ventilation)

## Complications

Ultrasound-guidance significantly reduces complication rates

[3]
Pneumothorax (4-19%)
Cough (9%)
Infection (2%)
Hemothorax
Splenic injury
Diaphragmatic injury
Hepatic injury
Vascular injury /bleeding
Air embolism
Reexpansion pulmonary edema Treatment should include supportive care with noninvasive ventilation as needed Diuresis is not a primary treatment for reexpansion pulmonary edema
