## Background

Defined as sodium concentration <135meq/L [1]
Patients often not symptomatic until <120meq/L, although this level varies by patients and may be higher if the change occurred abruptly [2]
Too fast of sodium correction (>10 mmol/L/day), especially if chronic, can cause osmotic demyelination syndrome (central pontine myelinolysis) [3]

### Hyponatremia Symptoms by Severity[2]

Severity NOT severe Moderately severe Severe Symptoms Gait disturbances Falls Concentration Cognitive deficits Nausea without vomiting Confusion Headache Vomiting Cardiorespiratory distress Abnormal and deep somnolence Seizures Coma (GCS <8)

### Symptoms from Rapid Correction of Sodium

CHF
Osmotic demyelination syndrome (central pontine myelinolysis) Altered mental status Dysphagia Dysarthria Paresis

#### Renal Causes

Thiazide diuretic use
Na-wasting nephropathy ( RTA , CKD)
Osmotic diuresis ( glucose , urea)
Aldosterone deficiency

#### Extra-renal Causes

GI loss
3rd space loss
Burns
Pancreatitis
Peritonitis

### Hypervolemic

Urinary Na >20 Renal failure
Urinary Na <20 Nephrotic syndrome Cirrhosis CHF

### Euvolemic

SIADH urine sodium is greater than 20-40 mEq/L
Pain, stress, nausea
Psychogenic polydipsia
Hypothyroidism
Drugs [4] [5] NSAIDs , sulfonylurea , bupropion
H 2 0 intoxication
Glucocorticoid deficiency

### Pseudohyponatremia

Hyperglycemia Na+ decreases by 2.4mEq/L for each 100mg/dL increase in glucose over 100mg/dL [6]
Displaced sodium in lab specimen Hyperlipidemia Hyperproteinemia

### Work-Up

Prior to giving treatment
Urine Urinalysis Urine electrolytes (Urine sodium) Urine urea urine uric acid urine osmolality urine creatinine
Serum Chemistry including Ca/Mg/Phos Serum osmolality Uric acid TSH Cortisol

### Diagnosis

True serum sodium (corrected) based on serum glucose [2]
Algorithm for hyponatremia diagnosis
Correct for glucose (see table)
Determine volume status
Calculated osm (in true hyponatremia the osm is reduced)

#### Hypertonic Hyponatremia

Defined as osmolarity > 295mmol/L with the following causes:
Hyperglycemia Sodium decreases by 2.4mEq/L for each 100mg/dL increase in glucose over 100mg/dL [6]
Mannitol excess

#### Isotonic (pseudo) hyponatremia

Defined as osmolarity > 275-295mmol/L.  Often referred to as pseudo hyponatremia because the elevated lipids or proteins interfere with the laboratory sodium reading.  The following are common causes:
Hyperlipidemia
Hyperproteinemia

#### Hypotonic Hyponatremia

Defined as an osmolarity < 275 mmol/L and categorized as hypovolemic , hypervolemic or euvolemic

## General Management

Must have sufficient confidence that the symptoms are caused by hyponatraemia; see Clinical Features for definition of categories.

### NOT Severe/Moderately-Severe (Including Asymptomatic)

Adults: [2]
Start prompt diagnostic assessment and provide cause-specific treatment
Check serum sodium concentration after 4 hours Aim for a 5 mmol/l per 24-h increase in serum sodium concentration Limit increase to 10 mmol/l in the first 24 h (8 mmol/l during every 24 h thereafter), until a serum sodium concentration of 130 mmol/l is reached
Manage the patient as in moderately-severe symptomatic hyponatraemia if the serum sodium concentration decreases 10 mmol/l

### Moderately Severe Symptoms

Adults: [2]
3% hypertonic saline 150 mL bolus over 20 min
Start prompt diagnostic assessment and provide cause-specific treatment
Check serum sodium concentration after 1, 6 and 12 hours Aim for a 5 mmol/l per 24-h increase in serum sodium concentration Limit increase to 10 mmol/l in the first 24 h (8 mmol/l during every 24 h thereafter), until a serum sodium concentration of 130 mmol/l is reached
Consider DDAVP (2mcgs IV q8h) to prevent overcorrection
Manage the patient as in severely symptomatic hyponatraemia if the serum sodium concentration further decreases despite treating the underlying diagnosis (2D).

### Severe Symptoms

Adults: [2]
3% hypertonic saline 150 mL bolus over 20 min
Check serum sodium concentration after 20 min
Repeat infusion of 150 ml 3% hypertonic saline for the next 20 min
Repeat twice or until a target of 5 mmol/l increase in serum sodium concentration is achieved Each 100 mL will raise sodium by ~2 mmol/l In general, 200-400 mL of 3% hypertonic saline is reasonable dose in most adult patients with severe symptomatic hyponatremia, which may be given IV over 1-2 hr until resolution of seizures.
If you do not have 3% hypertonic saline you can give two ampules (100ml) of crash cart hypertonic bicarbonate (1 mEq/ml sodium bicarbonate equivalent to giving ~200 ml of 3% saline, which will raise the serum sodium by ~3 mM) [7] . Sodium bicarbonate should be given slowly (each ampule over 5-10 minutes).  Bicarbonate is contraindicated in patients with metabolic alkalosis.
Pediatrics: [8]
2 mL/kg  of 3% over 10-60 minutes can be infused with a repeat of up to 3 times.

### Hypertonic hyponatremia

Correct underlying disorder which is often hyperglycemia [9]
Often volume depleted due to osmotic diuresis and normal saline provides adequate volume repletion

### Isotonic (pseudo) hyponatremia

No treatment needed [9]

### Hypotonic hyponatremia

Hypovolemic Give normal saline, but be cautious of raising the serum sodium more than 10 mmol/L/day and causing osmotic demyelination syndrome (central pontine myelinolysis) [10]
Euvolemic [9] Water restrict Treat underlying cause
Hypervolemic Water restriction Diuresis Treat underlying cause

## Calculating Sodium Replacement Therapy

Max correction 10mEq/L in first 24hr (8 mmol/l during every 24 h thereafter), until a serum sodium concentration of 130 mmol/l is reached (lowers risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome ) [10]

### Step 1

Calculate total body water
[11]
TBW(kg) = Wt(kg) x 0.6 = [Wt(lb) x 0.45] x 0.6 = Wt(lb) x 0.27

### Step 2

Calculate mEq deficit
(Desired Na - Measured Na) ~ must be ≤ 10

### Step 3

Calculate NS rate to be given over 24hr
NS rate (cc/hr) = TBW x mEq deficit x 0.27
If using 3% sodium chloride (to avoid volume overload) divide above rate by 3.33
Sodium Containing fluid Concentrations
Fluid type Sodium Concentration 1/2 Normal Saline 77 mEq/L Normal Saline 154 mEq/L Lactated Ringers 130 mEq/L 3% Saline 513 mEq/L

## DDAVPCombined with Hypertonic Saline

Limited evidence suggests usage of DDAVP in combination with HTS can safely increase sodium, while lowering risk for over-correction [12] DDAVP prevents free water excretion renally Give 3% hypertonic saline based on calculations above Give desmopressin 1-2 µg IV q6 hours Patients must be PO water restricted
Goal sodium is 6 mEq/L over first 24 hours

## Disposition

Admit if symptomatic or if Na <125mEq/L
Manage severely symptomatic patients in "an environment where close biochemical and clinical monitoring can be provided" (e.g. ICU)
