## Indications

Lateral view showing abdominopelvic cavity.
Posterior view of the anterior abdominal wall in its lower half.
View of Hesselbach's triangle from inside the abdomen showing the right inferior epigastric artery and vein arching superio-medially.
Diagram of sheath of Rectus above the arcuate line.
Ascites appearance on ultrasound
Rule-out SBP
Ascites analysis
Clinical deterioration in a patient with ascites (e.g. fever, abdominal pain or tenderness, encephalopathy, acidosis, deterioration in renal function, peripheral leukocytosis) [1]
Therapeutic in patient with discomfort from tense ascites

### Paracentesis if coagulopathic

Coagulation studies are NOT required before performance of the procedure [2] Incidence of clinically significant bleeding complications is low even if in liver failure with an elevated INR (< 0.2%) [3]
No data supports cutoff values beyond which paracentesis should be avoided/prophylactically transfused
Routine use of FFP and platelets is not recommended
Procedure is contraindicated if the patient is actively bleeding or in DIC

## Equipment Needed

Lidocaine with epi
Chlorhexidine
Paracentesis kit (catheter, 11 blade, syringes, bandage)
Abdominal bedside ultrasound
Vacuumed bottles

## Procedure

Use ultrasound to identify safe ascites pocket to drain and mark the area of entry if possible if no ultrasound available, can percuss to identify pocket Try to pick site away from inferior epigastric artery Prefered location is that with the greatest pocket, past history of success, and furthest distance from bowel [4] Midline infraumbilicus is avascular (linea alba) but may have lower success rate
Prep area
Anesthesize area with Lidocaine
Use needle to enter peritoneum, advance catheter upon withdrawing ascitic fluid
Attach cathether to vacuum bottles for therapeutic tap, Withdrawal with syringe for diagnostic tap

### Albumin

Consider albumin infusion of 1.5gm/kg in cirrhotics with SBP or with renal insufficiency to reduces the risk of circulatory dysfunction and hepatorenal syndrome [5]

### Pearls

Placing culture in blood culture tube increases yield
Z-track method involves pulling skin downwards with one hand while inserting needle to create nonlinear track Theoretically reduces risk of ascitic leak

### SBPWork-Up of Ascitic Fluid viaParacentesis

Cell count with differential
Gram stain
Culture (10cc in blood culture bottle)
Glucose
Protein

### Consider

Albumin and SERUM albumin
LDH and SERUM LDH at same time
Amylase

### Specific circumstances

TB smear and culture
Cytology
TG
Billirubin

#### Standard Evaluation

Paracentesis results supporting a diagnosis of SBP: Absolute neutrophil count (PMNs) ≥250, pH <7.35, OR blood-ascites pH gradient >0.1 [6] Bacteria on gram stain (single type) SAAG > 1.1 Diagnostic of portal hypertension with 97% accuracy [7] SBP rarely develops in patients without portal hypertension Protein < 1, Glucose > 50 (otherwise concern for secondary bacterial peritonitis)
For bloody tap, subtract 1 WBC for every 250 RBC [8]

#### If on peritoneal dialysis

See Peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis
Cell count >100/mm with >50% neutrophils most consistent with infection [9]

### Spontaneous versus secondary bacterial peritonitis

Importance of distinction Mortality of secondary bacterial peritonitis (eg. perforated appendicitis , cholecystitis ) ~100% if treatment is only antibiotics without surgery Mortality of unnecessary surgery in patients with SBP ~80%
Laboratory findings Secondary bacterial peritonitis strongly suggested by: Neutrocytic fluid (PMN ≥250) with two or more of the following: Total protein concentration >1 g/dL (10 g/L) Glucose concentration <50 mg/dL (2.8 mmol/L) LDH greater than upper limit of normal for serum Ascitic alk phos >240 Gram stain Large numbers of different bacterial forms
Imaging If evidence of secondary bacterial peritonitis obtain abdominal imaging If no evidence of free air or contrast extravasation then surgery is not indicated

## Complications

Hemorrhage (0 to 0.93%) [10]
Abdominal wall hematoma
Mesenteric hematoma
Bladder or bowel perforation (6 out of 1000)
Inferior epigastric aneurysm
Vessel laceration (aorta, mesenteric artery, iliac artery)
Hypotension
Infection (0.58 to 0.63%)
Persistent ascitic fluid leak (5%) May be minimized with Z-track method
