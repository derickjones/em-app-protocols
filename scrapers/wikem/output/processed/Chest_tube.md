## Introduction

This page is for adult patients. For pediatric patients, see: chest tube (peds)

## Indications

Hemothorax
Abscess
Empyema
Traumatic pneumothorax (some) Indication for thoracotomy in OR: >1200ml (20ml/kg) drainage immediately after insertion or continous 150-200 mL/hr for 2-4 hours or persistent 7ml/kg/hr at any time
Spontaneous pneumothorax (some)
Chylothorax

### Relative Indications

Penetrating thoracic injury and need for positive pressure ventilation
Profound hypoxia/hypotension in patient with penetrating chest injury
Profound hypoxia/hypotension and signs of hemothorax

## Contraindications

No absolute contraindications when performed for emergent indication.

### Relative contraindications

Overlying skin infection
Coagulopathy
Multiple pleural adhesions

## Equipment Needed

Chest tube 14-28F for pneumothorax 32-40F for hemothorax
Scalpel
Kelly Clamp
Sterile drapes
Silk sutures
Syringes and needles for anesthesia
Lidocaine
Betadine
Sterile gown/gloves
Face shield
Pleur-evac

## Procedure

Left pleura cavity (viewed from left) showing intercostal bundles (vein, artery, and nerve) directly under the ribs.
Consider antibiotic (e.g. cefazolin )
If possible; Elevate HOB to 30-60 degrees to lower diaphragm-decreasing risk of injury to diaphragm/intra-abdominal organs
Expose insertion site by moving upper extremity above head on affected side Insertion site = mid- to ant axillary line at 4th/5th intercostal space ~Nipple line in men, inframammary crease in women Place 1-3 intercostal spaces higher in pregnant patients (esp those in 3rd trimester) due to elevated diaphragm.
Clean with betadine and drape
Confirm rib space and anesthetize with up to 5mg/kg of lido with or with out epinephrine Must anesthetize skin, soft tissue, muscle, periosteum, and pleural space
Incise along upper border of the lower rib of the intercostal space
Use curved clamp to bluntly dissect through the muscle until you reach the rib
Angle the clamp to go above and over the rib and push until enter the pleural space
Open the clamp and pull it out with the clamp still open to create a larger tract
Premeasure chest tube from skin incision to ipsi clavicle to avoid advancing chest tube too far
Clamp the prox end of the chest tube and pass it along the tract into the pleural cavity Ensure that inner tract/incision can fit your finger and tube It helps to have your finger in the tract and pass the tube along your finger, particularly in obese patients
Once in the space, remove the clamp
Feed the chest tube until all the holes are inside the thoracic cavity Aim superoanterior for pneumothorax; aim posteriorly for hemothorax Controversial as to whether this is important
Rotate the tube 360 degrees Reduces likelihood of tube kinking If tube rotates easily, can help indicate correct location inside pleural cavity
Attach distal end of tube to the pleur-evac and place on suction (20-30cmH2O suction)
Secure tube with silk suture and cover with gauze and cloth tape
Obtain CXR position of tube

### AdultChest TubeSizes

Chest Tube Size Type of Patient Underlying Causes Small (8-14 Fr) Most spontaneous pneumothorax (primary and secondary) Most iatrogenic pneumothorax Alveolar-pleural fistulae (small air leak) Iatrogenic air Medium (20-28 Fr) Traumatic pneumothorax Traumatic hemothorax ("any acute hemothorax visible on chest radiograph") [1] [2] Pneumothorax on mechanical ventilation Non-traumatic tension pneumothorax Malignant effusion Trauma/bleeding (hemothorax/hemopneumothorax) Bronchial-pleural fistulae (large air leak) Malignant fluid Large (36-40 Fr) Empyema Thick pus

### Drainage System and Suction

Spontaneous pneumothorax The least amount of suction (including none) needed to maintain full expansion of the lung is appropriate Starting with Heimlich valve (no suction) or -10 cm of water and increasing only as needed
Fluid drainage -20 cm of water Increased as indicated with the goal of achieving full lung expansion
For thoracic trauma, few data are available Start -20 cm of water

## Complications

Exsanguination (secondary to removing the tamponade effect of the hemothorax) Clamp tube immediately; take patient to the OR for emergent thoracotomy
Air leak Reason why you never clamp the tube once it is in place (could cause tension pneumothorax)
Failure
Infection Give prophylactic antibiotics (e.g. Ancef ) to decrease rate of empyema
Re-expansion pulmonary edema
Damage to nerves/vessels/heart/lung/diaphragm/abdomen
Improper positioning of the tube
Tension pneumothorax

### Failure to drain

Improper connections or leaks in the external tubing / water seal system
Improper positioning of tube
Occlusion of bronchi or bronchioles by secretions or foreign body
Tear of one of the large bronchi
Large tear of the lung parenchyma
Clotting of a smaller diameter chest tube or pigtail catheter by blood (may require low dose TPA to declot pigtails)
If pneumothorax persists or large air leak despite well-placed tube need emergent bronchoscopy
