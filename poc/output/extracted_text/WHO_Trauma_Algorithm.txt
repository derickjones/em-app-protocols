Trauma Resuscitation Algorithm
Recognize
Recognize a seriously injured patient using the
Interagency Integrated Triage Tool (IITT).
Move patient to red or
resuscitation area.
Resuscitate
Use the ABCDE approach to systematically
evaluate the patient, identify and correct
immediate life threats.
ABCDE Approach
Remember special considerations
in paediatric,
elderly or pregnant patients.
Is the patient talking normally with no signs of obstruction?
For major
external
haemorrhage,
control bleeding
first!

LOOK FOR:
Not speaking, with limited or no air movement
ACT:
Use jaw thrust with c-spine protection.
• Suction if needed, remove visible foreign objects.
Place OPA to keep the airway open.
• Signs of possible airway injury (neck haematoma Give oxygen. Monitor closely - swelling can rapidly block the airway.
or wound, crepitus, stridor)
• Arrange for urgent advanced airway management.
.
Signs of possible airway burns (soot around the
mouth or nose, burned facial hair, facial burns)
LOOK FOR:
• Give oxygen. Monitor closely - swelling can rapidly block the airway.
• Arrange for urgent advanced airway management.
Does the patient have increased work of breathing, abnormal breathing pattern, abnormal
breath sounds, cyanosis, chest wounds? *Check oxygen saturation.
• Signs of tension pneumothorax (hypotension with
absent breath sounds/hyperresonance on one
side, distended neck veins)
Open (sucking) chest wound
Breathing not adequate
• Large burns of chest or abdomen (or
circumferential burn to limb)
Signs of flail chest (section of chest wall moving
in opposite direction with breathing)
Signs of haemothorax (decreased breath sounds
on one side, dull sounds with percussion)
LOOK FOR:
Signs of shock (capillary refill >3 sec,
hypotension, tachycardia)
Uncontrolled external bleeding
Signs of tamponade (poor perfusion, distended
neck veins, muffled heart sounds)
LOOK FOR:
• Signs of brain injury (AMS with wound, deformity
or bruising of head/face)
⚫ Signs of open skull fracture (as above, with blood
or fluid from the ears/nose)
LOOK FOR:
E
Wet or constrictive clothing
. Snake bite
ACT:
Perform needle decompression.
Give oxygen, IV fluids.
Arrange for urgent chest tube.
•
Give oxygen, place 3-sided dressing, monitor for tension pneumothorax.
Arrange for urgent chest tube.
Give oxygen, assist ventilation with BVM.
• Give IV fluids per burn size, give oxygen, remove constricting clothing/jewellery.
May need escharotomy.
• Give oxygen and provide pain medication.
May need advanced airway management and assisted ventilation.
Give oxygen, IV fluids.
• Arrange for urgent chest tube.
Does the patient have external or internal bleeding, distended neck
veins, muffled heart sounds or poor perfusion? *Check BP, HR, capillary refill.
ACT:
• Give oxygen, IV fluids, control external bleeding, splint femur/pelvis as
indicated.
Apply pressure, deep wound packing or tourniquet as indicated.
Give IV fluids, oxygen. Urgently refer to surgeon.
Does the patient have head trauma, convulsions, unequal or fixed pupils,
movement in all extremities. *Check AVPU. *Always check blood glucose.
ACT:
• Immobilize cervical spine, check glucose, give nothing by mouth.
. Will need neurosurgical care
• As above, and give IV antibiotics per local protocol.
Does the patient have hidden injuries, rashes or other lesions?
*Expose and examine the entire body.
ACT:
• Remove wet clothing and dry skin thoroughly.
Remove jewellery, watches & constrictive clothing.
Prevent hypothermia and protect dignity.
Immobilise extremity. Arrange for early anti-venom if relevant and available.
CHECK:
Is airway clear?
CHECK:
.Re-evaluate Airway
. Re-intervene
. Reach out to
advanced provider
Is breathing adequate?
CHECK:
⚫ Re-evaluate Airway
and Breathing
⚫ Re-intervene
. Reach out to
advanced provider
Is perfusion adequate?
⚫ Re-evaluate Airway,
Breathing and
Circulation
⚫ Re-intervene
. Reach out to
advanced provider
CHECK:
Is mental status improved?
.Re-evaluate Airway,
Breathing, Circulation
and Disability
⚫ Re-intervene
Reach out to
advanced provider

Review
Refer
Review patient status and
interventions using the
WHO Trauma Care Checklist.
Recheck vital signs.
If patient condition changes, repeat ABCDE.
If no further interventions needed, take a SAMPLE history and perform a SECONDARY exam.
Document care in a WHO Standardised Clinical Form or locally available option.
If health facility unable to provide on going care, arrange for safe
transfer to appropriate facility as soon as possible.
REMEMBER: PREPARATION is key. Use the elements of the WHO Emergency Care Toolkit to prepare your unit to better manage emergencies.
